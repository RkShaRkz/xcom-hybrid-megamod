Now our workshop technicians can exchange Inert Elerium for Carapace Armor from the previous war or for new weapon prototypes."
  STR_CHURCH_DATA: "Church Data Bank"
  STR_CHURCH_DATA_UFOPEDIA: "The presence of Aquatoids in a city center was a great surprise to us. We now understand that cultists have been helped by the Aliens to restore an artifact salvaged from a UFO that was shot down during the previous war. Analysis shows that this is an Alien computer, which contains mostly communication protocols, but it is also capable of hyperwave broadcasts. We are unable to decipher the broadcasts, but we have found a list of previous broadcasts. Shockingly, the first record seems to be a repeating message dated from over ten years ago.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Importantly, we've also found copies of S.O.R.E.S.O. reports stolen from our archives. Among other things, they contain the approximate location of the 'Khimtar' crash site. By strange coincidence, it is near the shipwreck of the RMS Titanic.{NEWLINE}Terabytes of personal data of cult members were found as well. However, such personal data is of no value to us, so we've transferred the data to Interpol, which should eventually curtail the threat of the Church of Sirius." 
  STR_SORESO_WRECK: "Khimtar Prototype Black Box"
  STR_SORESO_WRECK_UFOPEDIA: "Our analysis of the prototype wreckage indicates that the craft was sunk during an attack from an unknown enemy. According to our aquanauts' reports, the wreckage area was infested with Xarquids, which are capable of such attacks.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}In addition to telemetry and other technical specifications, we found a matrix of map coordinates. We believe these coordinates mark UFO crash sites from the previous war, and we should now be able to compare these records with the corrupted S.O.R.E.S.O. data to locate wreckage sites of interest."
  STR_SORESO_WRECK_PRE: "S.O.R.E.S.O. Craft Wreckage Analysis"
  STR_NAGA_SOCIETY: "Naga Society"
  STR_NAGA_SOCIETY_UFOPEDIA: "Now we know that the ancient myths were true. Naga dwelled in the oceans for millennia and contacted humans at regular intervals. What is more important to us, however, is the discovery that they've built temples on the sea bottom, which are undoubtedly devoted to their underwater god. Some of these facilities can be located now that we know what to search for."
  STR_NEURAL_COMPONENTS: "Alien Neurointerface Components"
  STR_NEURAL_COMPONENTS_UFOPEDIA: "These semi-organic machines serve to Aliens as computers, data cables and control devices. Sadly, some of their organic parts have human DNA. These devices have a narrow range of applications in our hands and only few of them can be recovered."
  STR_SYNOM: "Alien Synomium Device Fragments"
  STR_SYNOM_U: "Synomium Device"
  STR_SYNOM_UFOPEDIA: "The working principles of this device are completely perplexing. We hypothesize that it uses weak electromagnetic fields of high frequency to make some kind of connection with an unknown signal source. Using communications protocols extracted from a high-ranking Alien navigator, we can read the data from this source and partially decipher transmissions from the Alien communications network."
  STR_MC_DISRUPTOR_UFOPEDIA: "This advanced M.C. device allows its users to directly interfere with a host's implant. The device may only be used by aquanauts with M.C. skills. Successful attack with the disruptor causes the unit to becomes confused and it may panic.{NEWLINE}Has limited range.{NEWLINE}Max. Range: 15m"

  STR_INTRODUC: "The Mary Celeste Sinkings"
  STR_INTRODUC_UFOPEDIA: "In the past few years, shipping and civilian travel organizations all over the world became concerned as surface vessels and aircraft began disappearing with alarming frequency while crossing the world's oceans. Reports of strange submersible vehicles spotted at the sites of some of the disappearances were dismissed by world governments, but not by the general public. Responding to tabloid accounts of another possible Alien invasion, the public cried out for the governments of the world to reactivate the heroic X-Com organization as a precautionary measure.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Starting from the end of the previous Alien War, an organization called Sub-Oceanic Reconnaissance and Extraterrestrial Salvage Operations (S.O.R.E.S.O.), owned by F. Denman Williams, has been employed cataloging underwater UFO crash sites to then search for sealed Elerium containers among the wreckage. To appease the public, the world governments have taken control of key S.O.R.E.S.O. assets and have officially established 'Ocean Base 1' as X-Com's first operational command center." 
  STR_OCEAN1: "Ocean Base 1"
  STR_OCEAN1_UFOPEDIA: "Ocean Base 1 is our new headquarters. Confronting aquatic threats is a new effort for X-Com, so our tactics and weaponry must be developed practically from scratch. Though we possess some aquatic equipment, more complex tools must be researched, designed, and developed specifically for these needs. -->"
  STR_OCEAN1_1: "Ocean Base 1 page 2"
  STR_OCEAN1_UFOPEDIA_1: "Resources from the previous war will be of little help to us because all Elerium reserves have long since been exhausted, and almost all Alien technology based on Elerium requires it to function. Even our newest and best alloys use Elerium as a reactant for fabrication."
  STR_OCEAN2: "Water Pressure Concept"
  STR_OCEAN2_UFOPEDIA: "The ocean is a harsh environment. If the aquanaut's armor is sufficiently damaged, he/she will take stun damage each turn (only the under armor is relevant for the calculation).{NEWLINE}Stun damage also applies to aquanauts wearing any armor fundamentally not suitable for deep diving (e.g. Aqua-lung)."
  STR_OCEAN3: "Underwater Fire Concept"
  STR_OCEAN3_UFOPEDIA: "It is hard to set fire to something in the sea, so we employ special chemical compounds based on phosphorous, which is capable of burning in water. Incendiary rounds do very little direct damage - between 0 and 10 points per hit - but continue to deal damage every turn that a unit is standing in fire or on fire. This damage ignores armor ratings, but not armor resistances. We must keep this in mind, for who knows what we will face?"
  STR_OCEAN4: "Sniping Concept"
  STR_OCEAN4_UFOPEDIA: "To shoot targets which you cannot see, you need high expertise in aiming. If a unit cannot see his/her target, his/her aim receives a 50% penalty. Some weapons can reduce this penalty, but they are difficult to acquire."
  STR_OCEAN5: "Barrage Concept"
  STR_OCEAN5_UFOPEDIA: "Weapons with more than three shots in auto-shot mode can be fired as a barrage.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}'Ctrl + Shift + Click' to set the first target, then 'Click' to set the second target. The auto-shot will then be sprayed between these two points."
  STR_OCEAN6: "High Stun Concept"
  STR_OCEAN6_UFOPEDIA: "If a living unit (yours or the enemy's) takes too much stun damage, he/she will not just lay down silently, but lose a small HP quantity each turn. Watch for the high stun indicator."
  STR_OCEAN7: "Sonar Concept"
  STR_OCEAN7_UFOPEDIA: "To improve visibility underwater, we can employ sonar instead of trying to use surface nightvision. This allows us to see farther and to see through smoke, but color visibility will suffer. If an armor is equipped with sonar, then its range will be described in USOpedia article."
  STR_OCEAN8: "Disrupt Mission Concept"
  STR_OCEAN8_UFOPEDIA: "If we are persistent at sinking USO's, the Aliens may decide to abandon their current mission. Beware! The Aliens prioritize some missions over others, and they will try to complete their highest priority missions no matter the cost!  In many cases, the chances of making them stand down are not high."
  STR_OCEAN9: "Special Abilities Concept"
  STR_OCEAN9_UFOPEDIA: "Some types of armor suits, machines, or living beings possess special properties, from integrated weapons systems to the ability to spit acidic projectiles. To activate such an ability, click on the button in upper right corner of the screen, or press the 'W' button."

  STR_H_ACID: "Hydrophobic Acid"
  STR_H_ACID_UFOPEDIA: "We discovered a new class of organic acids, immiscible with water. A drop of this highly corrosive liquid can float freely without losing integrity until it makes contact with an obstacle. Upon contact the acid's adhesive properties cause it to spread to form a thinly covering film. This can become a dangerous weapon if used correctly."
  STR_H_ACID_WEAPONS: "Acid Weapons"

  STR_ALIEN_IMPLANTS: "Alien Implants"
  STR_ALIEN_IMPLANTS_DUMMY: "Alien Implants"
  STR_ALIEN_IMPLANTS_UP: "Further analysis of Alien cybernetic devices reveals an amazing picture. It seems that Aliens use implanted electronics as naturally as their own limbs. It is not only for communication, but all Alien devices, weapons, and even some creatures are controlled through implants. If we could adopt these devices it would be of great benefit to us on the battlefield and in everyday life. {NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}A major consequence of the Aliens implanting these devices is their full immunity to Psionic. This means our research on Psionics from the previous war will not be of use."
  STR_WORMS_EVOLVE: "Evolution of Mind Worms"
  STR_WORMS_EVOLVE_UFOPEDIA: "We've discovered a connection between the so called 'Mind Worms' and the so called 'Locusts' through our research. Our main hypothesis at this time is that Mind Worms possess an enormous capability to adapt to environmental conditions, the source of which lies in the Alien genetic programming written into each of their cells. {NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Since we do not have adequate knowledge of Alien genetics, we cannot predict their next form. What we do know about Worms at the moment is that they can float, create hard mineralized shells, and that they group in large hordes. Most importantly, though, is that they can sense neural activity at long range and interfere with it, causing panic and stun damage."
  STR_WORMS_HATCHERY: "Mind Worms Hatchery"
  STR_WORMS_HATCHERY_UFOPEDIA: "The samples found on the floating island prove the theory of the artificial evolution of Mind Worms.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Activation of some specimens during our operation can be explained by the Mind Worms' ability to sense brain waves. The thought of an island like this coming close to major city and fully activating brings chills to our bones. We must destroy those islands as quickly as we can."
  STR_MC_LAB_PRE: "Molecular Control"
  STR_MC_LAB_PRE_UFOPEDIA: "From battle reports of our aquanauts we know that some Aliens are capable of causing panic in or even taking control of a human body, even though no Psionic activity was detected. Interrogation of such a special creature will give us clues about these capabilities. {NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}We also suspect that these Aliens have a special type of implant. Research indicates that some Alien species are more capable of utilizing these implants than others, and some of them have mastered it enough to directly manipulate fine electromagnetic fields around them. Some can even manipulate these fields precisely enough to cause interferences in the neural system of a subject or even gain control over its body. Additionally, the implants make Aliens highly resistant to Psionic attacks. {NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}We believe that on the highest levels of Molecular Control mastery it may be possible to control matter directly, like some kind of telekinesis. We are also confident that Zrbite is connected to that possibility somehow."
  STR_MC_BIO: "Biological Molecular Control"
  STR_MC_BIO_UFOPEDIA: "While researching Mind Worms our biologists discovered an organ working as natural electromagnetic field emitter. We do not know if is this an experimental specimen created by the Aliens or a natural extraterrestrial evolutionary result. {NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Intense research of this tissue has lead us to some great discoveries, including the new use of Molectronic implants. Instead of just gaining control over Alien devices, we now possess the capability to interfere with a live organism's neural system to cause intense shock or maybe even to issue commands."
  STR_MC_SOLDIERS: "Special Recruits"
  STR_MC_SOLDIERS_UFOPEDIA: "Progress in the adaptation of Alien implants has allowed us to recruit specially prepared aquanauts as well as build appropriate training facilities. Our researchers have designed one such facility called the M.C. Lab, which we can now construct.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Available recruit specialties: {NEWLINE}M.C.-Gifted Aquanauts: Special screening processes reveal those who are more capable of Molecular Control. Theyr physical abilities are weaker than of professional soldiers. Screening process is also somewhat costly.{NEWLINE}M.C.-Protected Aquanauts: Using a special implant configuration, we can shield humans' minds from M.C. exposure. The drawback is the complete inability for these recruits to operate M.C. devices.{NEWLINE}Cyborg Aquanauts: These recruits' implants are focused on body improvement, raising all capabilities. These soldiers are stronger, faster, more agile, and better trained. They also can achieve physical characteristics that are not possible for ordinary people. The price they pay for this is diminished M.C. strength."

  STR_ALIEN_WRECK: "Old Alien Flight Records"
  STR_ALIEN_WRECK_UFOPEDIA: "The Alien data slate found in the UFO crash site contained UFO flight records. X-Com's own historic radar records indicate that some UFOs simply flew over the seas, apparently doing nothing substantial. Some of these UFOs were shot down over water and were assumed to be destroyed. We can now match the Alien data with old radar records to determine which of these sunken UFOs sent out distress signals, meaning they weren't completely destroyed. We'll then send out patrols to search for alloy concentrations or magnetic anomalies to find these sunken UFOs.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Additionally, the Alien records give us proof that Aliens were searching for something called 'The Silent One'. It is obvious now that whatever it was, it is associated with our new enemy. Their records also indicate that the final phase of their search involved battleship deployment, and our radar records show that this particular battleship was neutralized over water. We must locate this underwater crash site and search it for clues."

Found in a Naga City, it was guarded by their fiercest warriors, which likely means the relic is both sacred and ancient. Ages ago, the key was given to the Naga as a token needed to admit them to visit a 'sleeping god'. This 'right of passage' served a reward for their loyalty to this god."

DNA samples were too severely damaged during battle to determine the shape of the donor, but we have determined that it is no ordinary Alien. It looks like we arrived just in time, for who knows what we would have faced if this monstrosity had been ready to fight. Surely there is a source for this DNA, so we must find it. Perhaps interrogating Alien high commanders will give us a lead."
  STR_CLONE_CHAMBER_PRE: "Ancient Dungeon Analysis"
  STR_CULT_FHTAGN: Cult of the Drowned God
  STR_CULT_FHTAGN_UFOPEDIA: "Our analysis of recent events shows that Aliens are gaining control over small settlements in coastal regions using sophisticated Molecular Control techniques and religious-style brainwashing. They prefer primitive villages and small, isolated provinces. In these places Aliens are conducting genetic experiments on humans for unknown reasons. We must gain additional intelligence to stop them."
  STR_MUTATIONS: Mutations Analysis
  STR_MUTATIONS_UFOPEDIA: "A variety of samples show that there is no certain pattern in the genetic mutations of people affected by Alien experiments.

All who are not under control of the Alien mind will be misguided or destroyed by the city's defense systems.

The cultists believe that humanity might well have destroyed any hope of salvation by repelling the Alien occupation during the previous Alien War. The cult has been launching numerous deep space probes since the early 2030s, each of which carrying a message begging their 'Alien Saviors' to return to Earth and use their advanced technology to divert humanity off its path of self-destruction. After becoming officially outlawed by most world governments, the cult became an underground organization.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}It is not yet clear why the cultists have begun to terrorize civilians. There are rumors that to gain admission into the cult fanatics must contribute large sums of money and goods, so there is speculation that some candidates have banded together in gangs to prove their worth and make their robbery and piracy operations more likely to succeed. We must prevent these activities and investigate the cultists' relationship with the Aliens, if there is one."

We can expect more trouble from the Church unless we find their bases of operation and shut them down. According to the Fanatics, these bases are called 'Temples' by the cultists.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Curiously enough, despite some extraterrestrial species looking similar between our old enemies and our new ones, the Church does not profess the newly emerging Aliens as their gods.

  STR_CARCHARODON_SOLDIER: Carcharodon Soldier
  STR_CARCHARODON_UFOPEDIA: Recent battles with X-Com have forced the Aliens to accelerate their experimentation. The Carcharodons are the result. The Aliens have taken one of the fiercest predators in the ocean and adapted them for amphibious warfare. Although highly organized and intelligent, they are unable to control their predatory instincts for very long. They often turn on their wounded after battle and thus have no medics.
  STR_CARCHARODON_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This new species of shark is composed of both human and Alien DNA in addition to extensive cybernetic implants, allowing it to operate on land for short periods of time. Stomach contents show this carnivore has a huge appetite for raw flesh. Razor-sharp teeth and heightened senses along with a well-developed brain make this a deadly and fast predator. Its thick muscle slows the cutting power of melee weapons while its skin, composed of tiny teeth-like scales, has been reinforced with aqua plastics, protecting it from armor piercing rounds."

  STR_HEAVYAQUATOID_SOLDIER: "Enhanced Aquatoid Soldier"
  STR_HEAVYAQUATOID_UFOPEDIA: "It is not clear if Aquatoids are copying the features of our armor from us or developing it themselves, but they definitely have their own style. In fact, this is not an armored suit, but a symbiotic organism, giving increased protection and physical parameters to the otherwise quite weak and vulnerable Aquatoids. As a side effect, we have observed significantly decreased M.C. capabilities in the wearers, which may be related to suit's operatational needs."

  STR_JELLYMEN_SOLDIER: "Jellyman"
  STR_JELLYMEN_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The gelatinous bodies of these creatures came to our research facility heavily damaged. The reason for this is their flimsy structure and rapid decomposition. All we can determine is that their tissues are adapted to the high pressure of the oceanic abyssal depths, and that their nervous system is unusually highly developed. No cybernetic enhancements were found in the remains."
  STR_JELLYMEN_UFOPEDIA: "Jellymen, or as they call themselves, the Abyssians, are natural Earth creatures who dwell in the ocean's depths below 10,000 feet. They are sentient, demonstrating great skill in biology and fluid mechanics. On the battlefield they are dangerous opponents, preferring ranged combat and using bio-engineered organisms as weapons."
  STR_JELLYMEN_ORIGINS: "Jellymen Origins"
  STR_JELLYMEN_ORIGINS_UFOPEDIA: "Abyssians are an ancient civilization, living in deepest ocean caverns secretly and imperceptibly before their initial meeting with the Aliens. They are masters of genetic modifications and control of water streams. Now they have created an alliance with the Aliens, acquiring Zrbite power sources in exchange for bionic technology. Their goal now is to obtain sole control over the world's oceans.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}We believe there is a possibility to negotiate with them, and maybe even to convince them to change sides in this war. We just need to find a way to speak with a high-ranking Jellyman official."

  STR_JELLYMEN_TRADE: "Jellymen Tech Exchange"
  STR_JELLYMEN_TRADE_UFOPEDIA: "The Abyssians' understanding and development of the scientific fields of biology and genetics far surpass our own. With their knowledge and help, we can make a great step forward."

  STR_PROTOBIONT: "Protobiont Physiology"
  STR_PROTOBIONT_UFOPEDIA: "We now possess conclusive data about the green gelatinous amoebae found inside Calcinite suits. These beings have no cellular structure, much like the first living organisms on Earth. They can be described as a complex mixture of proteins, closer to viruses than bacteria. In macroscopic quantities, they can move effectively and even pursue prey. Growth is limited only by food availability. {NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Fortunately, humans are immune to Protobiont infection, so these organisms won't start an epidemic, but if injected into the bloodstream in large doses, they will devour any animal or human in seconds. As side effect of fast growth, they will heat up and emit extremely toxic waste.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}These organisms can be found naturally in the deepest caverns of the ocean bottom, protected from modern bacteria by extreme pressure and darkness, feeding off carrion. Aliens pack collections of Protobionts into hard shells and control them with Molectronic devices, turning them into strong and resilient puppets."

  STR_SPAWNER: "Breeder"
  STR_SPAWNER_UFOPEDIA: "This is a living organism used by Jellymen as weaponry. It can spawn aggressive larvae, which attack the target and chew through armor using highly corrosive venom. Damages armor and morale. We cannot reproduce such weaponry."
  STR_SUPRESSOR: "Squeezer"
  STR_SUPRESSOR_UFOPEDIA: "This is a living organism used by Jellymen as weaponry. Our researchers assert unanimously that the physical principles behind its actions are impossible. It can compress water around its targets, tearing them apart with a concentrated resultant vacuum pressure. Damages armor and TU. We cannot reproduce such weaponry."
  STR_TANGLER: "Tangler"
  STR_TANGLER_UFOPEDIA: "This is a living organism used by Jellymen as weaponry. It spits fast-hardening threads over short distances, tangling targets. Jellymen probably use these weapons to capture targets alive. Damages TU and delivers small amounts of stun damage. We cannot reproduce such weaponry."
  STR_INFECTOR: "Infector"
  STR_INFECTOR_UFOPEDIA: "This is a living organism used by Jellymen as weaponry. These creepy weapons release small larvae, acting as biosyringes to inject hyperactive organic fluids into the target. This infection can devour a human body in seconds, leaving a shapeless puddle of mucus in its place. This amoebic body is actually a protoform of a Calcinite. Use of these weapons seems too dangerous for our aquanauts."
  STR_VAMPIRE_WEAPON: "Vampire"
  STR_VAMPIRE_WEAPON_UFOPEDIA: "This unusual symbiont is used by Jellymen as a melee weapon of sorts. It can not only pierce armor with its claws, but simultaneously sucks blood from its targets. It then heals its master by injecting specific regenerative cells into the master's bloodstream."
  STR_BRAIN: "Handheld M.C. Shield"
  STR_BRAIN_UFOPEDIA: "This device contains a live Alien brain infused with multiple cybernetic devices. It can provide temporary additional protection, creating a slowly fading molecular shield around the wearer.{NEWLINE}To use the shield, place it in a hand slot and then activate it just as you would a grenade. As it loses power, the device will also lose its glow until it expires.{NEWLINE}Shield: 100,{NEWLINE}Shield loss per turn: 5"

  STR_PLASTIC_AQUA_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: "This armor utilizes the newly discovered Alien substance, aqua plastics, and ensures our aquanauts are given a fighting chance against the Alien incursion."
  STR_ION_BEAM_ACCELERATORS_UFOPEDIA: "Alien flying submarines rely on complex power systems to drive them at incredible speed through the seas. The basis for their technology is the Ion Displacer. Utilizing Zrbite as a catalyst, the engines displace 100 times their own volume in water per second. This enormous power means that the Aliens are capable of outrunning most Earth subs. We can replicate this system of propulsion using aqua plastics and Zrbite power cells."
  STR_ALIEN_SUB_CONSTRUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "Each vessel has a chameleon-like structure, carefully modeled on sea creatures and constructed of aqua plastics. Each submarine functions as an organism: crew and craft in harmony. Most of these systems can be replicated, and a hybrid technology can be evolved to allow us to move up to the same technological level."

It is beyond our technical ability to replicate this material as most of its constituents are Alien in origin."
  STR_EXAMINATION_ROOM_UFOPEDIA: "We now have the evidence needed to work out why Aliens capture humans. They are not food, and they are not fertilized with Alien embryos. Rather, captured humans form the basis of a range of creatures and control systems. Alien technology is based on a common mind, a shared intellect, and the human brain is the ideal receptacle for these systems. Human brain tissue is used in most of the Alien biological computer storage and retrieval systems. The remains are used for building and for breeding."

  STR_ALIEN_ORIGINSTWOTS_UFOPEDIA: "The Aliens strike all across the globe with ruthless efficiency. We cannot pin down their source. Could it be in some ocean deep too impenetrable for us to locate? Not all the organisms we have encountered are Alien. Some are very old, and some are from evolutionary paths long thought extinct. We are dealing with a menace that has been dormant for millennia, a subtle symbiosis of human and Alien. {NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Deep in the oceans there lie ancient sites used by the Aliens to contact their stellar cousins. Each of these twelve sites contains a Synomium Device, a powerful Alien technology. Now, with their war machine on the march, the Aliens are re-activating these sites to widen their Molecular Control net. We must destroy these sites at all costs."
  STR_JET_HARPOON_UFOPEDIA: "This aqua-rifle is accurate and powerful, firing hollow steel harpoons from sealed packs of nine. Each harpoon has its own gas reservoir."
  STR_AQUA_PLASTICS_UFOPEDIA: "Alien submarines and structures utilize an incredibly strong, flexible, and durable material for the majority of their construction. Aqua plastics are complex, multi-bonded, and Zrbite-catalyzed materials. Dense, yet light, the substance has strength properties above even titanium or Kevlar."
  STR_ALIEN_BASE_UFOPEDIA: "Aliens will construct secret undersea colonies in remote locations. After some initial reconnaissance flights, intense Alien sub activity will occur as the colony is being built. These colonies are known to contain labs, cloning centers, and surgical facilities for human and Alien experimentation. The presence of Alien colonies will generate more Alien activity even without the presence of Alien subs. In order to locate a colony, an X-Com sub must patrol an area for a few hours to stand some chance of successful detection."
  STR_ALIEN_RETALIATION_UFOPEDIA: "If X-Com intercept subs are being particularly successful in sinking Alien craft then the Aliens may take some aggressive retaliatory action. This could result in a direct attack against an X-Com facility. However, the Aliens have to find an X-Com base in order to attack it, and provided Alien subs are kept away, there should be little danger of an assault."
  STR_ALIEN_INFILTRATION_UFOPEDIA: "This can result in official contact between Aliens and corporations or governments at the highest levels. The climax of this activity is characterized by intense Alien sub activity in the waters of the organization concerned. The Aliens will attempt to sign an agreement with a government or an organization by offering knowledge of their superior technologies. This Alien activity represents a major threat to X-Com. If a corporation or government cooperates with the invaders then its funding ceases."
  STR_MC_LAB: "M.C. Lab"
  STR_STANDARD_SONAR_UFOPEDIA: "A standard sonar system has an effective range of over 3000 kilometers at most depths and is linked to geostationary satellite nets for surface analysis. Each scanner has a 10% chance of detecting a submersible or airborne craft per 30-minute scan cycle."
  STR_WIDE_ARRAY_SONAR_UFOPEDIA: "A wide array sonar system has an effective range of over 4700 kilometers at all depths and is linked to geostationary satellite nets for surface analysis. Each scanner has a 20% chance of detecting a submersible or airborne craft every 30-minute scan cycle."
