DESCRIPTION
-----------
The XCOM Terrain Pack contains 70+ terrains, as well as a new globe, to supplement those of the original UFO: Defense game while playing it through OpenXCom, UFO2000 or even the original game. It was originally created by Hobbes for his UFO2000 terrains, who later updated it for use in OpenXCom, and expanded it with the contributions of other authors.

The pack includes all published terrain mods for the original game made by Hobbes, and all the terrains made for the UFO2000 opensource multiplayer clone of the original XCom game (http://ufo2000.sourceforge.net/) by Hobbes and other authors. All of those were originally published and hosted on Hobbes' old Area 51 website (http://area51.xcomufo.com/), which was hosted on the http://www.xcomufo.com site until the page went offline dead around 2015. Several of Hobbes' terrains can also still be downloaded at the Strategycore.co.uk XCom site's forums (http://www.strategycore.co.uk/forums/topic/9389-ufo-terrain-mod/).

By then OpenXCom (https://openxcom.org/) made its 1.0 release, all of these mods were collected by the XCOM modding community, and made into a new Terrain Pack by Hobbes and several others, by updating the previous UFO2000 version to OpenXCom. Nearly all of these UFO2000 terrains were later converted by Hobbes to use in OpenXCom, as it was required to create new AI route nodes (.RMP files) for all of them in order to work with the original game and OpenXCom. The multiplayer versions didn't require those files and their old authors weren't around since the UFO2000 project went dormant about a decade ago, or knew anything about how the XCOM Tactical AI or the .RMP files worked. 

The current version of the XCOM Terrain Pack is specifically designed for OpenXCom and also includes new terrains created specifically for it by several authors and published on the OpenXCom forums, with the individual mod links provided on the included AUTHORS text file.

To keep all this material available in the future, the Terrain Pack contains a folder called \Original Files\ with all the .zip files of the terrains that were released and distributed on the Area 51 website as well as its relevant web pages. It also includes all the necessary XCom editors, tools and documentation that were used to create these terrain mods. This will allow everyone to keep playing them in the future and for XCom modders to keep using them to other terrains.

The XCOM Terrain Pack is also available at the OpenXCom mod portal - https://openxcom.mod.io/

Finally, if you'd like to give something back to Terrain Pack, a simple thank you message is more than enough. If you'd like to contribute, send us a message too.

And if you insist in donating, then please donate instead to OpenXCom (https://openxcom.org/donate/), or any of its developers, OXCE included. Due to their work, the original game is constantly being developed and updated with new features, and without them, the current XCOM Terrain Pack wouldn't be possible. Thank you.

TLDR - Players, follow the instructions to install and have fun.
