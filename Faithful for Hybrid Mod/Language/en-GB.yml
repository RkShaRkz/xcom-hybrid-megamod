  STR_LIGHT_ARMOR: "Light Armour"
  STR_LIGHT_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: "Standard-issue lightweight kevlar vests offer limited protection from the many hazards encountered in battle, such as shrapnel and flying objects. This armour cannot withstand direct hits from lethal weapons."
  STR_HEAVY_ARMOR_UC: "HEAVY ARMOUR"
  STR_HEAVY_ARMOR: "Heavy Armour"
  STR_HEAVY_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: "Cutting-edge metallurgical layering techniques enable us to mesh titanium alloys together to create an armour strong enough to resist small arms fire. Its defensive potential may not be enough to justify its weight."
  STR_BREACHER_UFOPEDIA: "Breachers are front line soldiers who specialize in entering the alien craft. They have exceptional reactions and are quick to adapt to any threat."
  STR_RANGER_UFOPEDIA: "Rangers are expeditionary soldiers who specialize in combat movement and support. They have excellent stamina and a variety of skills so that you can position them in strategic locations."
  STR_SNIPER_UFOPEDIA: "Snipers have excellent aim. They are invaluable for fire support, especially when positioned in cover with good visibility and an open line of sight to as many places as possible."
  STR_HEAVY_UFOPEDIA: "Heavies are strong and accurate. They operate the cumbersome weapons which take great care to operate safely and effectively. A heavy soldier is trained to suspend fire, to avoid friendly fire incidents."
  STR_ELITE_UFOPEDIA: "Elite soldiers are the top-scoring volunteers for the X-Com project. These are the best soldiers overall, and they come with a high cost."
  STR_PSIONIC_PRODIGY_UFOPEDIA: "It is exceptionally rare for humans to have a talent for psionics. If we search around the world, we can find people with that rare talent. They may require combat training to become effective soldiers."
  STR_SUPER_SOLDIER_UFOPEDIA: "The aliens have been experimenting with manipulating human genetics. We are able to utilise their research in order to improve combat potential in a soldier. X-Com has been allowed to produce a small number of modified soldiers, but only with explicit notarized permission from the willing participant."
  STR_FIRST_AID_KIT: "First-aid Kit"
  STR_FIRST_AID_KIT_UFOPEDIA: "The first-aid kit contains all of the supplies necessary for field triage. It can be used to bind wounds and stop the flow of blood, however injured soldiers are recommended to return to base as soon as possible for proper medical treatment."
  STR_MEDI_KIT_UFOPEDIA: "The medi-kit is a technologically advanced field surgery kit which can bind wounds rapidly by applying medical sealant compounds and antiseptics. It also contains citrate saline solution to assist with blood loss, and powerful stimulants and pain killers to keep soldiers operating on the battlefield even after being critically injured. This kit is not a substitute for proper surgical care, and the mission commander is strongly recommended to bring injured soldiers home as soon as possible."
  STR_PSI_AMP_UFOPEDIA: "The Psi-amp can only be used by soldiers with psionic skill. It enables a unit to control psionic waves in order to influence alien combatants. Mind probes contain psionic emitters, and Ethereal implants assist in focusing the psionic waves. We will need mind probes and Ethereal corpses in order to manufacture psi-amps."
  STR_FLYING_SUIT_UFOPEDIA: "A versatile new protection for soldiers, this armour contains an Elerium-powered anti-grav unit, allowing the soldier to levitate on the battlefield and move very quickly.

  STR_CONTAINING_ALIENS: "Aliens in Captivity"
  STR_CONTAINING_ALIENS_UFOPEDIA: "Our first attempts at capturing live aliens have resulted in failure. The aliens have been surgically altered to such an extent that they cannot sustain their normal functions for extended periods of time without assistance. They seem to need some sort of manufactured food product, and they require psionic stimulation to keep their brain functioning normally. We should explore more alien craft and habitats, and keep our eyes open for anything that might provide food, stimulation, entertainment, or other life support."
  STR_PSIONIC_TECHNOLOGY: "Psionic Technology"
  STR_PSIONIC_TECHNOLOGY_UFOPEDIA: "Psionic manipulation is a central function of much of the alien technology we recover. The aliens appear to use this technology to control other creatures. We should be able to use psionics against the aliens, but we will need to capture and research as many iterations of the technology as possible, including the specific aliens which use psionics and the devices that contain psionic emitters. For now, however, we can train soldiers to better resist psionic attacks from the aliens."
  STR_ALIEN_DIES_NO_ALIEN_CONTAINMENT_FACILITY: "Alien dies despite best attempts to save it"
  STR_ALIEN_HABITAT_UFOPEDIA: "The aliens are genetically engineered in order to enhance their capabilities.
